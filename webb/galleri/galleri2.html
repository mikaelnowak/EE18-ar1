            <p class="bildtext">When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the Moon during Apollo 11 in July 1969, he radioed to Earth that the landscape around him had "a stark beauty all its own." The whole Moon is like that. As proof, we offer this bright, young ray impact crater blasted in the eroded wall of the partly buried crater Hedin. It is distant from the starkly beautiful landscape Armstrong saw: the Apollo 11 landing site on Mare Tranquillitatis is more than 1000 kilometers to the east.</p>

            <p class="bildtext texthöger">NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter captured this detailed look at the floor of Komarov crater on the far side of the Moon. The spectacular fractures that cut across the floor of Komarov, which is about 53 miles (85 kilometers) in diameter, were formed when magma rose from the mantle, uplifting and fracturing the crater in the process. In this case The magma did not erupt to the surface, so the fractures remain visible. This image shows an area just over 9 miles (15 kilometers) wide.</p>

            <p class="bildtext">Get out your red/blue anaglyph glasses for a three-dimensional treat. This extreme closeup of the south edge of the Moon's famous Tycho Crater shows melt flows and pools, small craters, sagging slopes that look like ripples, boulders, and part of the crater rim. North is at the top. Image width is about six miles (10 kilometers).</p>

            <p class="bildtext texthöger">Astronauts Neil Armstrong and "Buzz" Aldrin landed the Apollo 11 Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) in Mare Tranquillitatis on July 20, 1969. They spent a total of 21.5 hours on the lunar surface, performing one Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) and collecting about 47 pounds (21.5 kilograms) of lunar samples.</p>

            <p class="bildtext">This photograph of astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Apollo 11 commander, was taken inside the Lunar Module (LM) while the LM rested on the lunar surface. Astronauts Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., lunar module pilot, had already completed their historic extravehicular activity (EVA) when this picture was made. Astronaut Michael Collins, command module pilot, remained with the Command and Service Modules (CSM) in lunar orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin explored the Moon's surface.</p>

            <p class="bildtext texthöger">The central peak in the Moon's Copernicus crater reveals the complexity of the lunar crust through distinct layering and patchy surface brightness. The area shown here is about 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) wide.</p>
